# PrintCommand
# this script shows how the print command works

# print a basic string
print("This is a basic print")

# you need parentheses - the print statement below will not work - uncomment and try it
# notice that if you leave this line in - Python will tell you
# "SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print("This won't work , you need parentheses")?
# print "This won't work , you need parentheses"
