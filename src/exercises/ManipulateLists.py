# make an empty list called:  list1

# put the numbers 12 through 255 inclusive into list1  [ inclusive means  12,13,...,255  , including the 12 and 255 ]

# select every 13th entry of list1 , starting at and including the 11th entry - put the results into list2

# remove the last 8 entries of list2

# remove the first 2 entries of list2

# convert the string "YakAttacksAreANormalPartOfLife"   into a list of letters - call it list3

# change list3 to only keep every 4th entry from its original list3

# remove the first letter 'k'  from list3

# make a copy of list2 , call it list4

# set the 5th element of list4 to be 37

# create list5 which is  the elements of list2 followed by elements of list4 , in a single list

# append 19 to list5

# keep only each 7th entry in list5

# insert the 2nd element of list5  into location 2  of list3

# insert the 1st element of list5 into location 7 of list3

# now lets print out the characters in list3
for i in list3:
    print(i,end="")
print()

# the string you just printed  will have some letters and numbers
# look for that string the mangled address above - and delete it.
# what is left will be an address for a google doc - go there and leave your mark
