Hello Natan, welcome to your working directory!

We're trying to give everyone a space where they can work on their own projects, and this one is yours.
Anything you do in this folder, we'll accept into the master RuCoBo repository. Feel the power!

In order to make sure that your work is properly working with our repo, here are the steps you should do

1. Update your project based on the most recent changes.
    You can do this by Selecting the "Update Project" option. It is the blue arrow pointing down & diagonally to the left
    You can also do this in the top menu by going to "VCS > Update Project..."
    Either of these will work, this will take any updates from our master repository and copy them to your computer.
    If prompted, select the option to "merge changes into your current branch"

2. As you work, periodically "commit" the work you've done. Committing gives you a snapshot of your code and you can
    recall it forever. It's really valuable to do whenever you take a break, or you get something working so that if you
    accidentally break it later, you can just go back (we'll talk about how to do that later)
    In order to commit your work, go to the "Commit" tab on the left of the screen. From there, you can select any
    files you've changed, add a meaningful comment and hit the "commit" button. Make sure you type a comment
    that makes sense to you, as it is how you'll keep track of what you've done.

3. When you're ready to share you work with everyone, you will need to "push" it to you copy of the RuCuBo repository
    that is on github. You can do this by selecting the "push" git command, it is the green arrow pointing up & right
    Or you can select this option from the pull down menu by selecting "VCS > Git > Push"
    Once you do this, your changes are securely stored on the internet for all of eternity, or until Microsoft goes
    out of business. We'll use this to make a request to the mast RuCuBu project for it to pull your changes into the
    master project. We call this a "pull request"

4. To create a pull request, go to your cloned repository in Github. You should double check that the main branch
    dshapiro1dev:master does not have any commits ahead of you (if it does, you likely need to revisit step one)
    Once you've done that, you'll see a gray box that will say "This branch is XX commits ahead..." and then there
    will be a button called "pull request", click that
    You will go to a new screen and there's a big green button that says "Create Pull Request" You will be able to
    give the request a title and an explanation of what you did. This is what will be seen by Daniel & Brian so that
    they can understand what your code does and make sure it won't break anything. They will review it, and once they
    approve it, everyone can get it by doing step one in this readme!
