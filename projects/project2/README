Project 2:

We will learn cement the knowledge from the last project:
- how to use debugger
- how to read/write files
- how to manipulate strings

easy: create your own encryption and decryption program.
The only rule is that when you take a text file (eg: one of the presidential speeches)
Run it through your encryption program
Run the output of that through your decryption program 
You should get the original file back exactly

hard: make an encryptor that also makes the encrypted version of the file as short as possible.
You can train your encryption on the presidential speeches.
Your code will be tested first to see how much shorter than the originals the encryptions are
on the given data.
Then run on a new english speech file you will not have seen before, and finally measured on how
well it can reduce the size of that via encryption.
