Project 3:

We will learn about built in Types:  /examples/builtin_types
- numbers
- strings (covered in project1)
- lists
- dictionaries
- tuples
- sets

Examples to read:

Assignment:
basic: read presidential speeches
       from first line - extract who the president is
       make a list of trivial words (a, the, it, that  etc)  ( you may need to edit/update this list )
       when analyzing speeches - remove the trivial words
       find most common words used by different presidents ( that are non-trivial)
       how often do presidents refer to themselves "i / me"
       ( you may need to run this multiple times - since you'll find many trivial words
         that you forgot, add them, and again rerun to see most common non-trivial words)

challenge: analyze the complexity of english language used by different presidents
           eg:  Flesch Kincaid  readability
       https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests
       how long are their typical speeches
       how long are the sentences
       how many speeches do they give per year
       output an analysis table - for each president - statistics about their speeches
       compute flesch-kincaid scores per president
       write this table to a file - one row per president, in calendar order - with all your statistics
extra credit:  do your own analysis of presidential speeches - what is interesting / different
