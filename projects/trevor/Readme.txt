Hello Trevor, welcome to your working directory!

We're trying to give everyone a space where they can work on their own projects, and this one is yours.
Anything you do in this folder, we'll accept into the master RuCoBo repository. Feel the power!

In order to make sure that your work is properly working with our repo, here are the steps you should do

1. Update your project based on the most recent changes.
    You can do this by Selecting the "Update Project" option. It is the blue arrow pointing down & diagonally to the left
    You can also do this in the top menu by going to "VCS > Update Project..."
    Either of these will work, this will take any updates from our master repository and copy them to your computer.
    If prompted, select the option to "merge changes into your current branch"

2. As you work, periodically "commit" the work you've done. Committing gives you a snapshot of your code and you can
    recall it forever. It's really valuable to do whenever you take a break, or you get something working so that if you
    accidentally break it later, you can just go back (we'll talk about how to do that later)
    In order to commit your work, go to the "Commit" tab on the left of the screen. From there, you can seelct any
    files you've changed, add a meaningful comment and hit the "commit" botton. Make sure you type a comment
    that makes sense to you, as it is how you'll keep track of what you've done.

3. When you're ready to share you work with everyone, you will need to "push" it to you copy of the RuCuBo repository
    that is on github. You can do this by
